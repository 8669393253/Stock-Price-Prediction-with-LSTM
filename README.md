# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-LSTM
This project demonstrates how to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict future stock prices. The project involves three main steps: preprocessing the data, training the LSTM model, and making predictions using new stock data. Below is a detailed explanation of the three parts of the project.
